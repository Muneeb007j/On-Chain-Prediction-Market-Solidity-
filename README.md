# On-Chain Prediction Market (Solidity)

A decentralized on-chain prediction market built on Ethereum that allows users to create prediction markets, stake ETH, and automatically claim rewards based on verified outcomes. The system is powered by secure Solidity smart contracts and integrates with a React/Next.js frontend using MetaMask for seamless wallet interaction.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Create decentralized prediction markets on-chain  
- Stake ETH on different outcomes  
- Automatic reward distribution via smart contracts  
- Trustless and transparent market resolution  
- MetaMask wallet integration  
- Fully decentralized backend powered by Ethereum

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Blockchain:** Ethereum  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity  
- **Development Framework:** Hardhat  
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js  
- **Wallet Integration:** MetaMask

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/on-chain-prediction-market.git
cd on-chain-prediction-market
````

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

npm install

### 3️⃣ Compile smart contracts

npx hardhat compile

### 4️⃣ Run tests

npx hardhat test

## 🧪 Local Development

Start a local Hardhat node:

npx hardhat node

Deploy contracts locally:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

Start frontend:

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

## 🔐 Security Notes

* Smart contracts are developed using best practices
* ETH transfers and reward logic are handled fully on-chain
* Tested locally using Hardhat


## 📌 Future Improvements

* Oracle-based outcome resolution (e.g., Chainlink)
* Support for ERC20 token staking
* UI/UX enhancements
* Multi-market analytics dashboard
